# Leonis

## General Information

Leonis is a densely populated city beneath the surface of the moon with the same name. Unable to step foot outside of the city without a vacc-suit, the population feels somewhat trapped beneath the Empire's thumb. It was this sentiment that led to the rise of the Socialist Party of Leonis and Loise Valdez. While most see Valdez as a man of the people, many in the city see him as a divine being, following the spirit of his movement blindly.

The temperature outside the city is cold, staying below 0&deg;F most days and falling far beneath that at night.

The Law Level is 9.

There is an AMBER traveller alert on this planet, advising caution when visiting.

The population is approximately 6,449,460,000.
