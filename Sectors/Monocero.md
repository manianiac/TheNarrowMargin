# Monocero

## General Information

Monocero, the tenth moon orbiting Kazi, is a densely populated settlement that took poorly to the reappearance of the Empire when the [Silence](https://manianiac.github.io/TheNarrowMargin/wiki/TheSilence) was broken. Currently ran by the descenants of the original steward of Monocero, though a couple of movements have begun to take control back for the people.

The atmosphere on the moon is relatively thin, gathering in settled valleys. However, the air itself is not breathable by humans, requiring a filtration mask to spend time outside of the settlements themselves. The temperature rarely rises above 15&deg;F, and the trace amounts of water on the planet are frozen.

The Law Level is 9.

The population is approximately 703,300.
