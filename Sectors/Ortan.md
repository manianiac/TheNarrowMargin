# Ortan

## General Information

Ortan, a moon orbiting Alfabh, is a populated settlement reliant on outside trade to stay functioning. While their habitats are functioning on more advanced Imperial technology, they are unable to repair it themselves. Democratic in nature, the leading party is stuck trying to broker profitable trade deals with the Empire.

The atmosphere on the moon is somewhat thin. However, the air itself is not breathable by humans, requiring a filtration mask to spend time outside of the settlements themselves. The temperature is earthlike, though it tends towards colder temperatures due to the atmosphere's thinness.

The Law Level is 4.

The population is approximately 5,350.
